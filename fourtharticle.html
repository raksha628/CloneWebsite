    <p>There are very few sources of pleasure in the world that can match the joy of travelling to a new city. Especially for those who
enjoy indulging in art, taking a cruise vacation to a picturesque region that also hosts museums and galleries, is a phenomenal
experience. Nothing gets those creative juices flowing like discovering the art scene of a city far from yours. So, grab your
cameras or easels and embark upon a journey to these six inspiring cities of famous art:</p>

<h1>1. London, England</h1>
<p>There is never a dull day in London for an appreciator of art as the city is home to many galleries and arts museums. Most of
them are also free to visit, which makes the capital city an art lover’s paradise. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London
showcases applied arts from around the world, including furniture, jewellery, fashion, glasswork, ceramics and sculpture. The
Tate Britain is another art museum you must visit when you make a trip to London. The building contains the largest collection
of British art in the world, with pieces dating from the 1500s to modern times. The National Gallery, located in Trafalgar
square, is also a delight to visit as it hosts over 2,300 works of art. Cruise enthusiasts can visit the National Maritime Museum
in Greater London to browse through paintings that focus on the many moods of the sea and the travails of navigation.</p>

<h1>2. Florence, Italy</h1>
<p>Simply stepping into the city of Florence brings you face-to-face with art. From public piazzas to famous galleries- art is
everywhere. The Galleria dell’Accademia houses the renowned ‘David’ by Michelangelo, besides other sculptures by the artist
and a collection of breath-taking Renaissance paintings. The Uffizi, on the other hand, is located near the sparkling Arno River
and must be visited if you wish to behold the world’s most fascinating collection of Italian Renaissance art. Very close to the
Uffizi gallery, is the Loggia dei Lanzi, an open-air museum that showcases antique sculptures. Built in the 14th century, this
museum is very easily accessible as it requires no entry fee.</p>

<h1>3. Singapore</h1>
<p>All art lovers must consider, taking a cruise trip to Singapore in order to experience the best that the seas have to offer,
combined with the wonders of the most vibrant city in the world. The best Asian contemporary art can be enjoyed at the
Singapore Art Museum, which was inaugurated in 1996. Pay a visit to the National Gallery to indulge in an extensive
collection of Singaporean and Southeast Asian art that dates from the 19th century, all the way down to modern times.
Another building that houses priceless pieces of art is the Peranakan Museum, dedicated to the culture of Peranakansdescendants of Straits Born Chinese. The items displayed at the museum include carved wedding bands and stunning
ceremonial costumes.</p>

<h1>4. Aarhus, Denmark</h1>
<p>Arhus is Denmark’s second-largest city and a buzzing cultural hub. A walk down the city’s cobblestone streets will lead you to
discover a seemingly endless number of galleries where you can spend hours browsing through art. The ARoS Aarhus
Kunstmuseum, established in 1859, is one of the largest art museums in Northern Europe. You can visit the ten-storey
building to observe the museum’s large art collection as well as special exhibitions of Danish artists. The roof of the museum
features an iconic rainbow panorama basement, while the gallery in the basement is influenced by Dante’s The Divine
Comedy.</p>

<h1>5. Paris, France</h1>
<p>No list of art destinations of the world can ever be complete without a mention of the charming city of Paris. History and art
are present at every corner of the city, and vacationers can begin with a visit to the Musée Carnavalet, which is a tribute to the
tumultuous history of Paris. The Musée Picasso, as the name suggests, allows one to browse through the works of Pablo
Picasso and the Maison Européenne de la Photographie is dedicated to modern photographic art. Visitors also throng to the
famous Louvre museum, which has become a central landmark of the city. Another art museum, the Musée d’Orsay,
showcases works by remarkable artists including Van Gogh, Manet, Cezanne and Renoir.</p>

<h1>6. Melbourne, Australia</h1>
<p>Melbourne is known as ‘Australia’s Cultural Capital’ for a reason. It offers a rather democratic approach to art, as paintings
and sculptures can be found on walls and streets all across the city, for everyone to enjoy free of cost. This makes travelling by
foot or riding the tram a delightful experience. The walls on Union Lane, in particular, feature some spectacular street art. The
Ian Potter Centre is one of Melbourne’s top attractions and houses impressive collections of fashion, sculpture, photography
and paintings. The MUMA, or Monash University Museum of Art, is one of Melbourne’s newer museums and features
Australian contemporary art as well as pieces by artists from other countries.</p>
